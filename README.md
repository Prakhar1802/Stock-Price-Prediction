# 📈 Stock Price Prediction App

This project is a web-based application built using **Streamlit** that predicts future stock prices using a trained **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network model. The app provides visualizations of historical stock data and generates short-term price forecasts based on that data.
